📘 Wireshark Packet Capture – Analysis Report
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Wireshark is used for capturing, analyzing, and understanding network traffic.
Traffic was generated by browsing websites and using ping commands. Captured packets were analyzed to identify protocols, behaviors, and packet details.

🛠 Tools Used

Wireshark (Kali Linux)

Terminal (ping, browsing for traffic)

.pcap export file

🚀 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Installed Wireshark
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark -y
2️⃣ Started Capture on Active Interface

Opened Wireshark → selected active interface (wlan0/eth0)

Started packet capture

3️⃣ Generated Traffic

Browsed websites

Used ping commands:
ping google.com
4️⃣ Filtered Captured Packets
http
dns
tcp
icmp
tls
5️⃣ Exported Capture as .pcap
File → Export Specified Packets → .pcap
Identified Protocols

At least three protocols were observed in the capture. Below are the findings:

🔷 1. DNS (Domain Name System)

Used for resolving domain names to IPs

Observed DNS Queries & Responses

Port: 53 (UDP)

Example:

Query: google.com

Response: IP address returned

🔷 2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Handles reliable data transfer & connection setup

Seen during website browsing and TLS connections

Observed 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK)

Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), random ephemeral ports

🔷 3. ICMP (Ping Protocol)

Used for testing connectivity

Seen when running ping google.com

ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply

🟦 Additional Protocols Observed
4. TLS (HTTPS Encrypted Traffic)

Used for secure web communication

Most website traffic was encrypted

Port: 443

Data inside packets is unreadable (encrypted)

5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Used inside LAN to map IP to MAC

Observed ARP Requests & Replies

🧪 Sample Packet Details
🔹 DNS Query Packet

Protocol: DNS

Info: “Standard query A google.com”

Source: Local machine

Dest: DNS server

🔹 TCP SYN Packet

Protocol: TCP

Info: SYN – starting connection

Source Port: random

Destination: 142.250.xxx:443 (Google)

🔹 ICMP Echo Request

Protocol: ICMP

Info: Echo (ping) request

Destination: 1.1.1.1 / google.com

🔹 TLS Application Data

Protocol: TLS

Info: Encrypted HTTPS data

Meaning: Secure browsing traffic

📊 Final Summary

The network capture contains normal and expected traffic generated through browsing and ping operations. Key protocols (DNS, TCP, ICMP, TLS, ARP) were identified and analyzed. No malicious or abnormal packets were seen. Traffic patterns matched typical user web activity.
